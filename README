To compile the assembler I used the command
gcc -o assembler assembler.c assembler.h
./assem "test-suite/sample.tk" 
~ I replaced "sample.tk" with whichever input file I used, for example t1.tk, t2.tk and so forth

To compile the sinulator I used the command
gcc -o simulator simulator.c
./sim "test-suite/sample.tko" 
~ if the input file was t1.tk the output would be t1.tko
